- `requirements.txt` - Added numpy and scikit-learn dependencies
- `README.md` - Updated with comprehensive usage examples and RL documentation

## 🚀 Key Features

### Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
1. **Feature Extraction**: Analyzes query types, data complexity, and response characteristics
2. **Reward Calculation**: Converts user ratings and feedback into numerical rewards
3. **Pattern Learning**: Learns from positive examples (high ratings) and avoids negative patterns
4. **Response Enhancement**: Applies learned preferences to improve future responses

### User Experience Improvements
- **Robust Input Handling**: Enhanced validation and error handling for feedback collection
- **Multiple Feedback Options**: Main app integration, standalone utility, or skip entirely
- **Real-time Statistics**: Immediate feedback on model performance and learning progress
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## 📊 Benefits

### For Users
- **Improving Response Quality**: AI gets better over time based on actual usage
- **Personalized Experience**: System learns individual and collective user preferences
- **Flexible Interaction**: Multiple ways to provide feedback or opt out entirely

### For Development
- **Data-Driven Enhancement**: Objective metrics for response quality improvement
- **Continuous Learning**: Automatic model improvement without manual intervention
- **Scalable Growth**: System improves automatically as user base grows

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test basic functionality with feedback
python pcap_ai.py --pcap "test.pcap" --key "key.txt" --query "What protocols are used?"

# Test without feedback collection
python pcap_ai.py --pcap "test.pcap" --key "key.txt" --query "What protocols are used?" --no-feedback

# Test standalone feedback collection
python collect_feedback.py

# Test model training
python train_model.py --show-stats
```

### Compatibility Testing
