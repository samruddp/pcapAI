        "question": "Can you tell me the file ids that we are interacting with in the packtet trace for NFS packets?",
        "response": "Certainly! In the packet trace for NFS packets, the file IDs we are interacting with are as follows:\n\n1. **File ID:** 110252609\n   - This file ID appears in several NFS packets, specifically in packets with procedures like `GETATTR` and others.\n\n2. **File ID:** 110252711\n   - This file ID also appears in multiple NFS packets, including those with procedures like `CREATE`, `WRITE`, and `GETATTR`.\n\nThese IDs are found within the NFS layer of the packets."

        "question": "show me the first setattr packet and which attributes are being set in this?",
        "response": "The first `SETATTR` packet is packet number 25. The `SETATTR` operation is part of the NFS protocol, and it is used to set attributes of a file or directory.\n\nIn this packet, the following attributes are being set:\n\n- `Mode`: The mode being set is `448`, which corresponds to the permissions `0700`. This means the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, while the group and others have no permissions.\n- `Set_it`: The value is `1`, indicating that attributes are being set.\n\nThese attributes are related to the file identified by the file handle provided in the packet."

        "question": "show me the first setattr packet and which attributes are being set in this? Can you also provide UID and GID values?",
        "response": "The first `setattr` packet in the data is packet number 25. This packet contains a procedure call to set attributes, indicated by the NFS (Network File System) procedure `procedure_v3` with a value of `2`, which corresponds to the `SETATTR` operation.\n\nThe attributes being set in this packet are:\n- File handle length (`fh_length`): 60\n- File handle hash (`fh_hash`): 0xc351b99c\n- Mode (`mode3`): 448, which corresponds to file permissions in octal mode `0700`. This means the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, while group and others have no permissions.\n- Set mode flag (`set_it`): 1, indicating the mode is being set.\n\nThe UID and GID values for this packet are:\n- UID (`auth_uid`): 501\n- GID (`auth_gid`): 20\n\nThese values indicate the user and group identifiers for the file operation."
