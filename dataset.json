        "response": "Yes, we can determine the number of write requests sent from the client and their lengths from the data.\n\nThe write requests in NFS are indicated by the procedure number \"7\". From the analysis data, there is one NFS write request sent from the client with the following details:\n\n- Packet number 53 contains an NFS write request where the procedure number is \"7\". The length of this request is 622 bytes, with a reassembled data length of 4900 bytes.\n\nThus, there was one write request sent from the client, with the write request itself having a reassembled data length of 4900 bytes."

        "response": "The first `setattr` packet in the data is packet number 25. This packet contains a procedure call to set attributes, indicated by the NFS (Network File System) procedure `procedure_v3` with a value of `2`, which corresponds to the `SETATTR` operation.\n\nThe attributes being set in this packet are:\n- File handle length (`fh_length`): 60\n- File handle hash (`fh_hash`): 0xc351b99c\n- Mode (`mode3`): 448, which corresponds to file permissions in octal mode `0700`. This means the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, while group and others have no permissions.\n- Set mode flag (`set_it`): 1, indicating the mode is being set.\n\nThe UID and GID values for this packet are:\n- UID (`auth_uid`): 501\n- GID (`auth_gid`): 20\n\nThese values indicate the user and group identifiers for the file operation."

        "response": "In the packet trace, a \"GETATTR\" request in NFS (Network File System) is usually identified by the NFS procedure number 1 within the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) layer. By examining the data, there are several packets where the NFS procedure_v3 is \"1\", indicating a \"GETATTR\" request. Specifically, these packets are numbered: 1, 29, 37, 45. Therefore, there are four \"GETATTR\" requests seen in the packet trace."
